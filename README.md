# Python utilities

This is a small folder for python scripts to make life easier :)

- treesearch: Iterate through a specific folder and search for file content in the folder as well as its subdirectories.
- image-resizer: Resizes an image to a specific size while keeping aspect ratio (and also reduces file size a bit).
    - **Requires**: [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- yt-dl: Python wrapper for executing a specific command via [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
    - Simplifies the workflow a bit, so that the command doesn't need to be typed in the console every time. Mainly using this for downloading music as `.mp3`.

_treesearch_ and _image-resizer_ were useful for the [osu! wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/), a knowledge base for the rythm game osu!.
