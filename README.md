# Python utilities

This is a small folder for python scripts to make life easier :)

- treesearch: Iterate through a specific folder and search for file content in the folder as well as its subdirectories.
- image-resizer: Resizes an image to a specific size while keeping aspect ratio (and also reduces file size a bit).

These tools came in handy at the [osu! wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/).

**Requires:**

- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
